FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP
======================================

Create a file named '.env' in this frontend directory with the following content:

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# Cloudinary Configuration (Optional - for direct frontend uploads)
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The VITE_API_BASE_URL should point to your backend server (default: http://localhost:5000/api)
2. Cloudinary frontend config is optional since uploads are handled by the backend
3. Save this file as '.env' in the frontend directory
4. Restart your frontend server: cd frontend && npm run dev
